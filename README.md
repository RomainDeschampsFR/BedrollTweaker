# BEDROLL TWEAKER

## FEATURES :
  * Adjust the warmth, the weight, the daily decay rate and the on-use decay rate of bedrolls
  * Each bedroll type (Regular, improved down bedroll, bear skin bedroll and patchwork bedroll) has separated settings
  * Enable bedrolls to "stack" warmth bonuses
      * In real life, you would be able to use extra bedrolls for additional warmth and use them with beds
      * If you have more than 1 bedroll, you can get extra warmth from the additional bedrolls
      * If you use a bed with 1 or more bedrolls in your inventory, you can get extra warmth from the bedrolls
      * Many settings available to stack warmth bonuses the way you like.

  ## WARNING:
  * If you change the warmth, weight or decay of bedrolls while in-game, you will need to change scene to apply the changes.
  * Compatible with [CozyBlanket](https://github.com/ds5678/BlanketMod)
  * Compatible with [GearDecayModifier](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-gear-decay-modifier), but be aware that if you use BOTH to change bedroll decay, the efects are CUMULATIVE.
